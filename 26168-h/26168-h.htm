<h2><small>By HENRY SLESAR</small></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> Personnelovac winked,
chittered, chortled,
chuckled, and burped a card
into the slot. Colihan picked
it up and closed his eyes in
prayer.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord. Let this one be
all right!"</p>

<p>He read the card. It was
pink.</p>

<p>"<i>Subject #34580. Apt. Rat.
34577. Psych. Clas. 45. Last
Per. Vac.</i></p>

<p>"<i>An. 3/5/98. Rat. 19.
Cur. Rat. 14.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Analysis: Subject demonstrates
decreased mechanical
coordination. Decrease in
work-energy per man-hour.
Marked increase in waste-motion
due to subject's interest
in non-essential activities
such as horseracing. Indication
of hostility towards superiors.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Recommendation: Fire
him.</i>"</p>

<p>Colihan's legs went weak.
He sat down and placed the
card in front of him. Then,
making sure he was unobserved,
he broke a company
rule and began to Think.</p>

<p><i>Something's wrong</i>, he
thought. <i>Something is terribly
wrong. Twenty-four pink
cards in the last month.
Twenty-four out of forty.
That's a batting average of</i>&mdash;He
tried to figure it out
with a pencil, but gave it up
as a bad job. <i>Maybe I'll run
it through the Averagovac</i>,
he thought. <i>But why bother?
It's obvious that it's high.
There's obviously SOMETHING
WRONG.</i></p>

<p>The inter-com beeped.</p>

<p>"Ten o'clock department
head meeting, Mr. Colihan."</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/001.png" width="363" height="550" alt="" title="" />
<b><small>The steel brain was having more fun than people.</small></b></div>

<p>"All right, Miss Blanche."</p>

<p>He rose from his chair and
took the pink card with him.
He stood before the Action
Chute for a moment, tapping
the card against his teeth.
Then, his back stiffened with
a sense of duty, and he slipped
the card inside.</p>

<hr />

<p>The meeting had already
begun when Colihan took his
appointed place. Grimswitch,
the Materielovac operator
looked at him quizzically.
<i>Damn your eyes, Grimswitch</i>,
he thought. <i>It's no crime to
be three minutes late. Nothing
but a lot of pep talk first
five minutes anyway.</i></p>

<p>"PEP!" said President
Moss at the end of the room.
He slammed his little white
fist into the palm of his other
hand. "It's only a little word.
It only has three little letters.
P-E-P. Pep!"</p>

<p>Moss, standing at the head
of the impressive conference
table, leaned forward and
eyed them fixedly. "But those
three little letters, my
friends, spell out a much bigger
word. A <i>much</i> bigger
word for General Products,
Incorporated. They spell
PROFIT! And if you don't
know how <i>profit</i> is spelled,
it's M-O-N-N-E-Y!"</p>

<p>There was an appreciative
laugh from the assembled department
heads. Colihan,
however, was still brooding
on the parade of pink cards
which had been emerging
with frightening regularity
from his think-machine, and
he failed to get the point.</p>

<p>"Naughty, naughty," Grimswitch
whispered to him
archly. "Boss made a funny.
Don't forget to laugh, old
boy."</p>

<p>Colihan threw him a sub-zero
look.</p>

<p>"Now let's be serious," said
the boss. "Because things
<i>are</i> serious. Mighty serious.
Somewhere, somehow, <i>somebody's</i>
letting us down!"</p>

<p>The department heads
looked uneasily at each other.
Only Grimswitch continued
to smile vacantly at the little
old man up front, drumming
his fingers on the glass table
top. When the President's machine-gunning
glance caught
his eyes, Colihan went white.
<i>Does he know about it?</i> he
thought.</p>

<p>"I'm not making accusations,"
said Moss. "But there
is a let-down someplace.
Douglas!" he snapped.</p>

<p>Douglas, the Treasurer, did
a jack-in-the-box.</p>

<p>"Read the statement," said
the President.</p>

<p>"First quarter fiscal year,"
said Douglas dryly. "Investment
capital, $17,836,975,238.96.
Assets, $84,967,442,279.55.
Liabilities, $83,964,283,774.60.
Production costs
are&mdash;"</p>

<p>Moss waved his hand impatiently.
"The meat, the
meat," he said.</p>

<p>Douglas adjusted his
glasses. "Total net revenue,
$26,876,924.99."</p>

<p>"COMPARISON!" The
President screamed. "Let's
have last first quarter, you
idiot!"</p>

<p>"<i>Ahem!</i>" Douglas rattled
the paper in annoyance. "Last
first quarter fiscal year net
revenue $34,955,376.81. Percent
decrease&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind." The little
old man waved the Treasurer
to his seat with a weary gesture.
His face, so much
like somebody's grandmother,
looked tragic as he spoke his
next words.</p>

<p>"You don't need the Accountovac
to tell you the
significance of those figures,
gentlemen." His voice was
soft, with a slight quaver.
"We are not making much
p-r-o-f-i-t. We are losing
m-o-n-e-y. And the
point is&mdash;what's the reason?
There must be <i>some</i> reason."
His eyes went over them
again, and Colihan, feeling
like the culprit, slumped in
his chair.</p>

<p>"I have a suggestion," said
the President. "Just an idea.
Maybe some of us just aren't
showing enough p-e-p."</p>

<p>There was a hushed silence.</p>

<p>The boss pushed back his
chair and walked over to a
cork-lined wall. With a dramatic
gesture, he lifted one
arm and pointed to the white
sign that covered a fourth of
it.</p>

<p>"See that?" he asked.
"What does it say?"</p>

<p>The department heads
looked dubious.</p>

<p>"<i>Well, what does it say?</i>"
repeated Moss.</p>

<p>"ACT!" The department
heads cried in chorus.</p>

<p>"Exactly!" said the little
old man with a surprising
bellow. "ACT! The word that
made us a leader. The word
that guides our business destiny.
The word that <i>built</i>
General Products!"</p>

<hr />

<p>He paced the floor. The
chairs in the conference room
creaked as the department
heads stirred to follow him
with their eyes.</p>

<p>"ACT is our motto. ACT
is our password. ACT is our
key to success. And why not?
The Brains do the thinking.
All of us put together
couldn't think so effectively,
so perfectly, so honestly as
the Brains. They take the orders,
designate raw materials,
equipment, manpower. They
schedule our work. They analyze
our products. They
analyze our people."</p>

<p>Colihan trembled.</p>

<p>"There's only one important
function left to us. And
that's ACT!"</p>

<p>The President bowed his
head and walked slowly back
to his seat. He sat down, and
with great fatigue evident in
his voice, he concluded his
polemic.</p>

<p>"That's why we must have
pep, gentlemen. Pep. Now&mdash;how
do you spell it?"</p>

<p>"P! E! P!" roared the department
heads.</p>

<p>The meeting was over. The
department heads filed out.</p>

<hr />

<p>Colihan's secretary placed
the morning mail on his desk.
There was a stack of memos
at least an inch thick, and the
Personnel Manager moaned
at the sight of it.</p>

<p>"Production report doesn't
look too good," said Miss
Blanche, crisply. "Bet we get
a flood of aptitude cards
from Morgan today. Grimswitch
has sent over a couple.
That makes eleven from him
this month. He really has his
problems."</p>

<p>Colihan grunted. <i>He deserves
them</i>, he thought.</p>

<p>"How did the meeting go?"</p>

<p>"Huh?" Colihan looked up.
"Oh, fine, fine. Boss was in
good voice, as usual."</p>

<p>"I think there's an envelope
from him in the stack."</p>

<p>"What?" Colihan hoped
that his concern wasn't visible.
He riffled through the
papers hurriedly, and came
up with a neat white envelope
engraved with the words:
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT.</p>

<p>Miss Blanche watched him,
frankly curious. "That will
be all," he told her curtly.</p>

<p>When she had left, he ripped
the envelope open and
read the contents. It was in
Moss's own cramped handwriting,
and it was a request
for a three o'clock "man-to-man"
talk.</p>

<p><i>Oh, Lord</i>, he thought. <i>Now
it's going to happen.</i></p>

<hr />

<p>President Moss was eating
an apple.</p>

<p>He ate so greedily that the
juice spilled over his chin.</p>

<p>Sitting behind his massive
oak desk, chair tilted back,
apple juice dappling his
whiskers, he looked so small
and unformidable, that Colihan
took heart.</p>

<p>"Well, Ralph&mdash;how goes
it?"</p>

<p><i>He called me Ralph</i>,
thought Colihan cheerfully.
<i>He's not such a bad old guy.</i></p>

<p>"Don't grow apples like
they used to," the President
said. "This hydroponic stuff
can't touch the fruit we used
to pick. Say, did you ever
climb a real apple tree and
knock 'em off the branches?"</p>

<p>Colihan blinked. "No, sir."</p>

<p>"Greatest thrill in the
world. My father had an
orchard in Kennebunkport.
Apples by the million. Green
apples. Sweet apples. Delicious.
Spy. Baldwin." He
sighed. "Something's gone
out of our way of life,
Ralph."</p>

<p><i>Why, he's just an old dear</i>,
thought Colihan. He looked
at the boss with new sympathy.</p>

<p>"Funny thing about apples.
My father used to keep 'em
in barrels down in the basement.
He used to say to me,
'Andrew,' he'd say, 'don't
never put a sour apple in one
of these barrels. 'Cause just
one sour apple can spoil the
whole derned lot.'" The boss
looked at Colihan and took a
big noisy bite.</p>

<p>Colihan smiled inanely.
Was Moss making some kind
of point?</p>

<p>"Well, we can't sit around
all day and reminisce, eh,
Ralph? Much as I enjoy it.
But we got a business to run,
don't we?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the Personnel
Manager.</p>

<p>"Mighty big business, too.
How's your side of it, Ralph?
Old Personnelovac hummin'
along nicely?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Colihan,
wondering if he should voice
his fears about the Brain.</p>

<p>"Marvelous machine, that.
Most marvelous of 'em all, if
you ask me. Sizes up a man
beautifully. And best of all,
it's one hundred percent
<i>honest</i>. That's a mighty important
quality, Ralph."</p>

<hr />

<p>Colihan was getting worried.
The boss's conversation
was just a little too folksy for
his liking.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, a mighty fine
quality. My father used to
say: 'Andrew, an honest man
can always look you in the
eyes.'"</p>

<p>Colihan stared uncomprehendingly.
He realized that
Moss had stopped talking, so
he looked him squarely in the
eyes and said: "He must have
been a fine man, your father."</p>

<p>"He was honest," said
Moss. "I'll say that for him.
He was honest as they come.
Did you ever hear of Dimaggio?"</p>

<p>"It sounds familiar&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It should. Dimaggio was a
legendary figure. He took a
lantern and went out into the
world looking for an honest
man. And do you know something?
He couldn't find one.
You know, Ralph, sometimes
<i>I</i> feel like Dimaggio."</p>

<p>Colihan gulped.</p>

<p>"And do you know why?
Because sometimes I see a
thing like <i>this</i>&mdash;" the boss's
hand reached into the desk
and came out with a thick
bundle of pink cards&mdash;"and I
wonder if there's an honest
man left in the world."</p>

<hr />

<p>He put the cards in front
of Colihan.</p>

<p>"Now, sir," said Moss.
"Let's talk a little business.
These cards are all pink.
That means dismissal, right?
That's twenty-four people
fired in the last month, is that
correct?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Colihan
unhappily.</p>

<p>"And how many cards
went through the Personnelovac
this month?"</p>

<p>"Forty."</p>

<p>"So that's twenty-four out
of forty. A batting average
of&mdash;" The boss's brow puckered.
"Well. Never mind. But
that's quite an unusual record,
wouldn't you say so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>So</i> unusual that it would
call for immediate ACTION,
wouldn't it?" The President's
face was now stormy.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. But I checked the
Brain&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did you, Ralph?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. And the Maintainovac
said it was perfect.
There's nothing wrong with
it."</p>

<p>"<i>Nothing</i> wrong? You call
twenty-four firings out of
forty <i>nothing</i>?" The old man
stood up, still holding the
core of his apple.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't understand
it either, Mr. Moss." Colihan
felt dew on his forehead.
"Nothing seems to satisfy
the Brain anymore. It seems
to develop higher and higher
standards, or something.
Why, I'm not sure it wouldn't
even fire&mdash;"</p>

<p>"WHO?" said Moss thunderously.
"WHO wouldn't it
even fire?"</p>

<p>The thunder hit Colihan
squarely. He swallowed hard,
and then managed to say:</p>

<p>"Anybody, sir. Me, for instance."</p>

<p>The President's face suddenly
relaxed.</p>

<p>"I'm no tyrant, my boy.
You know that. I'm just doing
a job, that's all."</p>

<p>"Of course, sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, all I want you to do
is keep your eye on things. It
could be a coincidence of
course. That's the <i>logical</i> explanation."
He narrowed his
eyes. "What do <i>you</i> think,
Ralph?"</p>

<p>"Me, sir?" said Ralph,
wide-eyed. "I don't <i>think</i>, sir.
I ACT, sir!"</p>

<p>"Good boy!" The boss
chuckled and clapped his
hand on Colihan's shoulder.
Moss was momentarily satisfied.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Personnelovac burped.</p>

<p>Colihan picked up the card
with a groan. It was pink.</p>

<p>He walked over to the Action
Chute and dropped it inside.
As it fluttered down
below, Colihan shook his head
sadly. "Thirty-one," he said.</p>

<p>He placed the next personnel
record into the Information
chamber. He flipped the
lever, and the Personnelovac,
now hot with usage, winked,
chittered, chortled, and
chuckled with amazing speed.
The burp was almost joyful
as the card popped out. But
Colihan's face was far from
joyful as he picked it up.</p>

<p>Pink.</p>

<p>"Thirty-two," he said.</p>

<p>The next card was from
Grimswitch's department. It
was Subject #52098. The
number was familiar. Colihan
decided to check the file.</p>

<p>"Sam Gilchrist," he said.
"<i>Couldn't</i> be anything wrong
with Sam. Why, he's a blinkin'
<i>genius</i>!"</p>

<p>Flip. Wink. Chitter. Chortle.
Chuckle. BURP!</p>

<p>Pink.</p>

<p>"Poor Sam!" said Colihan.</p>

<p>He fed the other records
through quickly.</p>

<p>Pink.</p>

<p>Pink.</p>

<p>PINK.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, Colihan
worked laboriously with
a blunt-pointed pencil. It
took him fifteen minutes for
the simple calculation.</p>

<p>"Sixty-seven tests. Twenty-three
okay. Forty-four&mdash;"</p>

<p>Colihan put his hands to
his head. "What am I going
to <i>do</i>?"</p>

<hr />

<p>Grimswitch followed Colihan
down the hall as he came
out of the boss's office for the
third time that week.</p>

<p>"Well!" he said fatuously.
"Quite the teacher's pet,
these days. Eh, Colihan?"</p>

<p>"Go away, Grimswitch."</p>

<p>"On the carpet, eh? Temper
a little short? Don't
worry." Grimswitch's beefy
hand made unpleasant contact
with the Personnel man's
shoulder. "Your old friends
won't let you down."</p>

<p>"Grimswitch, will you
please let me alone?"</p>

<p>"Better watch that think-machine
of yours," Grimswitch
chuckled. "Might fire
<i>you</i> next, old boy."</p>

<p>Colihan was glad when
Morgan, the production operator,
hailed Grimswitch away.
But as he entered his own office,
Grimswitch's words still
troubled him. <i>Grimswitch</i>, he
thought. <i>That fat piece of
garbage. That big blow-hard.
That know-it-all.</i></p>

<p>Almost savagely, he picked
up the day's personnel cards
and flipped through them
carelessly.</p>

<p><i>Grimswitch, that louse</i>, he
thought.</p>

<p>Then he had the Idea.</p>

<p>If Grimswitch was still
chewing the fat with Morgan,
then his secretary would be
alone&mdash;</p>

<p>If he called her and asked
for Grimswitch's record&mdash;no,
better yet, got Miss Blanche
to call&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Why not?</i> he thought. <i>After
all, I am the Personnel
Manager. Sure, it's a little
irregular. He IS a department
head. But it's my job, isn't
it?</i></p>

<p>Colihan flipped the inter-com
and proceeded to call Miss
Blanche.</p>

<hr />

<p>His hand shook as he
placed Grimswitch's card into
the Personnelovac.</p>

<p>The machine, though still
heated by the day's activity,
seemed to take longer than
usual for its chittering,
chuckling examination of the
pin-holed facts on the record.</p>

<p>Finally, it gave a satisfied
burp and proffered the result
to Colihan's eager hand.</p>

<p>"Aha!" cried the personnel
man gleefully.</p>

<p>He walked over to his
desk, wrote a quick note on
his memo pad, and placed
both note and card into an
envelope. He addressed it to:
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT.
Then he dropped it
into the Action Chute. When
it was out of sight, he rubbed
his hands together in happy
anticipation.</p>

<hr />

<p>When Miss Blanche announced
that President Moss
himself was in Colihan's
outer lobby, the Personnel
Manager spent a hasty minute
in straightening up the
paper debris on his desk.</p>

<p>The old man came striding
into the room, exhibiting
plenty of p-e-p, and he seated
himself briskly on Colihan's
sofa.</p>

<p>"Sharp eyes, Ralph," he
said. "Sharp eyes and a quick
wit. This business demands
it. That was a sharp notion
you had, doing a run-through
on Grimswitch. Never trusted
that back-slapping fellow."</p>

<p>Colihan looked pleased.
"Trying to do a job, sir."</p>

<p>"Put your finger on it,"
said Moss. "Hit the nail on
the head. It's just like my
father said: 'Trees go dead
on the top.' Colihan&mdash;" The
boss leaned forward confidentially.
"I've got an assignment
for you. Big
assignment."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!" said Colihan
eagerly.</p>

<p>"If Grimswitch is a sour
apple, maybe <i>other</i> department
heads are, too. And
who knows? IT knows."</p>

<p>Moss pointed a finger at
the Personnelovac.</p>

<p>"I'm rounding up all the
aptitude records of the department
heads. They'll be in
your hands in the next couple
of days. Feed 'em in! Root
'em out! Spot the deadwood,
Colihan! ACT!"</p>

<p>"ACT!" echoed Colihan,
his face flushed.</p>

<p>The old man got up and
went over to the Brain.</p>

<p>"Marvelous machine," he
said. "Honest. That's what I
like about it."</p>

<p>As Moss went out the door,
Colihan could have sworn he
saw the Personnelovac wink.
He walked over to it and fingered
the lever. It was turned
off, all right.</p>

<hr />

<p>It was an interesting week
for Colihan.</p>

<p>Morgan, the production
man, was fired.</p>

<p>Grimswitch came up to see
the Personnel man and tried
to punch him in the nose.
Fortunately, he was a little
too drunk, and the blow went
wild.</p>

<p>Seegrum, the Shipovac operator,
was fired.</p>

<p>Douglas, the Treasurer,
was permitted to keep his job,
but the Personnelovac issued
a dire threat if improvement
wasn't rapidly forthcoming.</p>

<p>Wilson, the firm's oldest
employee, was fired.</p>

<p>In fact, seven out of General
Product's twelve department
heads were greeted by
the ominous pink card.</p>

<p>Colihan, no longer plagued
by doubt, felt that life was
definitely worth living. He
smiled all the time. His
memos were snappier than
ever. His heels clicked merrily
down the office hallways. He
had p-e-p.</p>

<p>Then, the most obvious
thing in the world happened&mdash;and
Colihan just hadn't
foreseen it.</p>

<p><i>His</i> record card came up.</p>

<hr />

<p>"Have you run through the
stack yet?" Miss Blanche
asked.</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;just about." Colihan
looked at her guiltily. He
pushed his glasses back on
the bridge of his nose. "Couple
more here," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, we might as well
finish up. Mr. Moss would
like to have the schedule completed
this afternoon."</p>

<p>"It will be. That's <i>all</i>, Miss
Blanche."</p>

<p>His secretary shrugged and
left. Colihan went to the Personnelovac
with the record in
his hand. The file number was
630.</p>

<p>"Don't let me down," he
told the Brain.</p>

<p>He placed the pin-holed
card into the machine and
flipped the lever. It winked,
chittered, chortled, and
chuckled with almost sinister
softness. When the card was
burped out at the other end,
Colihan took it out with his
eyes firmly shut.</p>

<hr />

<p>He walked over to the Action
Chute mechanically. His
hand hesitated before he
dropped it inside. Then he
changed his mind, walked
back to the desk, and tore the
pink card into the smallest
possible shreds.</p>

<p>The inter-com beeped.</p>

<p>"Mr. Moss wants you," said
his secretary.</p>

<p>"Colihan!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir?"</p>

<p>"Don't act so innocent,
Colihan. Your report isn't
complete. It should have been
ready by now."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!"</p>

<p>"You're not ACTING, Colihan.
You're stalling!"</p>

<p>"<i>No</i>, sir."</p>

<p>"Then where's <i>your</i> Personnelovac
report, Colihan?
Eh? Where is it?"</p>

<p>Colihan wrung his hands.
"Almost ready, sir," he lied.
"Just running it through
now, sir."</p>

<p>"Speed it up. Speed it up!
Time's a'wastin', boy. You're
not <i>afraid</i>, are you, Colihan?"</p>

<p>"No, <i>sir</i>."</p>

<p>"Then let's have it. No
more delay! Bull by the
horns! Expect it in an hour,
Colihan. Understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!"</p>

<p>The boss clicked off. Colihan groaned audibly.</p>

<p>"What can I do?" he said
to himself. He went to the
Brain and shook his fist helplessly
at it. "Damn you!" he
cursed.</p>

<p>He had to think. He had to
THINK!</p>

<p>It was an effort. He jerked
about in his swivel chair like
a hooked fish. He beat his
hands on the desk top. He
paced the floor and tore at
the roots of his hair. Finally,
exhausted, he gave up and
flopped ungracefully on the
office sofa, abandoning himself
to the inevitable.</p>

<p>At that precise moment,
the mind being the perverse
organ it is, he was struck by
an inspiration.</p>

<p>The Maintainovac bore an
uneasy resemblance to Colihan's
own think-machine.
Wilson, the oldest employee
of General Products, had
been the operator of the
maintenance Brain. He had
been a nice old duffer, Wilson,
always ready to do
Colihan a favor. Now that he
had been swept out in Colihan's
own purge, the Personnel
Manager had to deal
with a new man named Lockwood.</p>

<p>Lockwood wasn't so easy
to deal with.</p>

<p>"Stay out of my files, mister,"
he said.</p>

<p>Colihan tried to look superior.
"I'm the senior around
here, Lockwood. Let's not
forget that."</p>

<p>"Them files is my responsibility."
Lockwood, a burly
young man, stationed himself
between Colihan and the
file case.</p>

<p>"I want to check something.
I need the service records
of my Brain."</p>

<p>"Where's your Requisition
Paper?"</p>

<p>"I haven't got <i>time</i> for
that," said Colihan truthfully.
"I need it <i>now</i>, you fool."</p>

<p>Lockwood set his face like
a Rushmore memorial.</p>

<p>"Be a good fellow, can't
you?" Colihan quickly saw
that wheedling wasn't the answer.</p>

<p>"All right," he said, starting
for the door. "I just
wanted to help you."</p>

<p>He opened the door just a
crack. Sure enough, Lockwood
responded.</p>

<p>"How do you mean, help
<i>me</i>?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you know?" Colihan
turned to face him. "I'm
running through an aptitude
check on the Personnelovac.
Special department head
check. Mr. Moss's orders."</p>

<p>"So?"</p>

<p>"I was just getting around
to yours. But I figured I'd
better make sure the Brain
was functioning properly."
He grew confidential. "You
know, that darned machine
has been firing <i>everyone</i>
lately."</p>

<p>A little rockslide began on
Lockwood's stoney face.</p>

<p>"Well ..." he said. "If
that's the case&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I knew you'd understand,"
said Colihan very
smoothly.</p>

<hr />

<p>Eagerly, the Personnel
Manager collated the records
of the Personnelovac. They
were far more complex than
any employee record, and it
took Colihan the better part
of an hour.</p>

<p>Any moment he expected
to hear the President's angry
voice over the inter-com. His
anxiety made him fumble, but
at last, the job was done.</p>

<p>He slipped the record,
marked by a galaxy of pinholes,
into the Brain.</p>

<p>"Now we'll see," he said
grimly. "Now we'll find out
what's eating this monster."</p>

<p>He flipped the switch.</p>

<p>The Personnelovac winked.</p>

<p>It was several minutes before
it digested the information
in its chamber. Then it
chittered.</p>

<p>It chortled.</p>

<p>It chuckled.</p>

<p>Colihan held his breath until
the BURP came.</p>

<p>The card appeared. It read:</p>

<p>"<i>Subject #PV8. Mech. Rat.
9987. Mem. Rat. 9995. Last
Per. Vac.</i></p>

<p>"<i>An. None. Cur. Rat. 100.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Analysis: Subject operating
at maximum efficiency.
Equipped to perform at peak
level. Is completely honest
and does not exhibit bias,
prejudice, or sentiment in
establishing personnel evaluations.
Cumulative increase
in mnemonic ability. Analytic
ability improving.</i>"</p>

<p>Colihan walked slowly over
to the Action Chute as he finished
reading the card.</p>

<p>"<i>However</i>," it read, "<i>because
of mechanistic approach
to humanistic evaluation,
subject displays inability
to incorporate human
equation in analytical computation,
resulting in technically
accurate but humanistically
incorrect deductions.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Recommendation: Fire
him.</i>"</p>

<p>Colihan dropped the pink
card into the chute. In half
an hour, the Action wheels
of General Products concluded
their work, and the Personnelovac
had winked for the
last time.</p>

(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
